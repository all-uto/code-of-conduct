## üéØ Our Philosophy

### Core Principle

**"No rules here, for any rule is unfreedom. We give choices."**

We operate on principles rather than rigid rules. We limit only the branches that prevent others from growing ‚Äî so freedom multiplies.

### TechnoHeroism Values

2. **Conscious Collaboration** - Mindful co-creation with others
3. **Ethical Innovation** - Technology that serves human flourishing
4. **Radical Inclusion** - Welcome all who come in good faith
5. **Growth Mindset** - Continuous learning and evolution

### The Three Laws (LOGOS Directives)

Inspired by the GMSF framework:

1. **Truth First** - Seek and speak truth, admit uncertainty
2. **Do No Harm** - Prevent suffering, promote wellbeing
3. **Maximize Freedom** - Expand possibilities, don't restrict unnecessarily

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

---

## üîÑ Appeals Process

### You Have the Right to Appeal

If you believe a moderation decision was unfair:

1. **Wait 48 hours** - Let emotions settle
2. **Contact different moderator** - Not the one who made decision
3. **Present your case:**
   - Why you believe decision was wrong
   - Any mitigating circumstances
   - What you've learned
   - How you'll do better
4. **Review** - Leadership team will review
5. **Decision** - Final decision will be communicated
6. **Accept outcome** - Gracefully accept final decision

### Appeal Rights

- One appeal per incident
- Appeals decided by consensus of leaders
- New evidence can warrant reconsideration
- False or bad faith appeals may worsen consequences

---

## üå± Restorative Justice Approach

Whenever possible and appropriate, we prefer restorative approaches:

### Elements of Restorative Justice

1. **Acknowledge Harm** - Offender recognizes impact
2. **Take Responsibility** - Accept accountability without excuses
3. **Make Amends** - Actively repair what was broken
4. **Learn and Grow** - Demonstrate changed behavior
5. **Rebuild Trust** - Gradually re-earn community standing

### When It's Appropriate

Restorative justice works best when:
- Harm was unintentional
- Offender shows genuine remorse
- Victim is willing to participate
- Community supports the process
- There's no ongoing danger

### When It's Not Appropriate

Immediate removal is better when:
- Behavior was predatory or criminal
- There's imminent danger
- Pattern of serious violations
- No genuine remorse shown
- Victim doesn't feel safe

---

## üí° Conflict Resolution Framework

Based on GMSF's three-cycle dialectical process:

### Step 1: Self-Reflection (Thesis)

Before addressing conflict:
- What happened from your perspective?
- What are your feelings and needs?
- What outcome do you want?
- Are you calm enough to engage?

### Step 2: Understanding (Antithesis)

Seek to understand the other:
- What's their perspective?
- What might they be feeling?
- What context might you be missing?
- Can you steelman their position?

### Step 3: Resolution (Synthesis)

Find higher ground:
- What's the shared goal?
- Where's the common ground?
- What solution serves everyone?
- How can you move forward together?

### When to Involve Moderators

- Direct dialogue has failed
- Power imbalance exists
- Safety is a concern
- Need neutral facilitator
- Behavior violates Code
